That being said, the quickest and easiest way to set a WebHook for your Bot is to issue a GET request to the Bot API (itâ€™s enough to open an url in your browser).

All you have to do is to call the setWebHook method in the Bot API via the following url:

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot{my_bot_token}/setWebhook?url={url_to_send_updates_to}
```
where
my_bot_token is the token you got from BotFather when you created your Bot
url_to_send_updates_to is the url of the piece of code you wrote to implement your Bot behavior (must be HTTPS)
For instance:
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11/setWebhook?url=https://www.example.com/my-telegram-bot
```
And youâ€™ve got it.
Now if you go to the following url (you have to replace {my_bot_token} with your Bot Token)
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot{my_bot_token}/getWebhookInfo
```
you should see something like this:
```
{
 "ok":true,
 "result": 
 {
   "url":"https://www.example.com/my-telegram-bot/",
   "has_custom_certificate":false,
   "pending_update_count":0,
   "max_connections":40
 }
}
```
For a complete list of parameters for the setWebHook method have a look at the official API reference.
